<p>
  I'm Corentin cadiou, a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.iap.fr/"><emph>Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (IAP)</emph></a>.

  My main research interests are the origin of the morphology of galaxies. I use simulations and numerical analysis to study the link between the initial conditions of the dark matter density field, the cosmic web, its filament and their connection to the galaxies.
