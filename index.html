<p>
I'm Néstor Espinoza, a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.astro.puc.cl" target = "_blank">Pontificia Universidad 
Católica de Chile</a> and part of the <a href="http://www.astrofisicamas.cl/?lang=en" target = "_blank">Millenium Institute 
of Astrophysics</a>. My main research interests are exoplanets: from detection and characterization to how they form and what they are made 
of. I'm also a big statistics enthusiast and love coding.
