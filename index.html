<p>
  I'm Corentin cadiou, a post-doctoral research assistant at the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/">department of physics and astrophysics, UCL</a>.
  I completed my PhD in 2019 at the <a href="http://www.iap.fr/"><emph>Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (IAP)</emph></a> on "The impact of the large scale structures of the Universe on dark matter halo and galaxy formation".
  My PhD is available <a href="https://pub.cphyc.me/Science/thesis_CorentinCadiou.pdf">online</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My main research interests are the origin of the morphology of galaxies.
  I use theory, simulations and numerical analysis to study the link between the initial conditions of the dark matter density field, the cosmic web, its filaments and their connection to galactic properties.
