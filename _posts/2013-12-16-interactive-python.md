excerpt: <p>My attempt to learn Python (and the basics of game development) at Coursera.</p>

Python has been on my list of languages to learn for several years. But up
until a few months ago, I had never taken the time to even look at the docs.
Coming from Ruby, I guess it always felt too similar. Improving my JavaScript
skills seemed like a better way to spend my time. But, back in October, I
happened upon the [Intractive Python course at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython) and decided to
give it a try. I've watched plenty of standalone instructional videos
(railscasts, peepcode, etc.) in the past, but prior to October, I hadn't
participated in a structured educational couse since college.

Coursera's Interactive Python course (taught by a handful of wiley CS
professors from Rice University) appealed to me for a number of reasons:

* Online learning is all the rage these days and I wanted to see what it was all about.
* Python has been on my list of languages to learn for several years.
* The course is based on building games in Python. I'd never done any real game development and it seemed like another cool thing to learn.
* The course was free.

Earlier this week, I finished my final program for the class - a fun little
game based on [Atari's 1979 classic,
Asteroids](http://www.atari.com/arcade/asteroids) ([view my version of the game](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user27_C7mE1hgmtpv7B8V.py) -
just click the 'play' button). In many ways, the original Asteroids is still
better, but building the game did teach me all about animating sprites,
collisions, and how to code a simple physics engine. I knew about these
concepts at a high level, but had no real world experience with them.

In addition to learning the basics of game development, I was taught the basics
of Python along the way. As the course is designed for beginner-level
programmers, there weren't many concepts that were new to me, but I still found
value in learning a bit of "The Python Way". Can I now be as efficient in
Python as in Ruby? No, but I have added another tool to the toolbox. I'll
likely still choose Ruby whenever I can, but I'll no longer shy away from
Python code.

Lastly, some comments about the sturcture of the course and the online learning
environment in general. The Coursera site itself felt very full-featured. It's
still a little rough around the edges, but its ability to offer video lectures,
quizzes, projects, and community forums was appreciated (by me, at least). The
instructor's videos were informative and reasonably well done and I enjoyed
their attempts at humor every now and then. Programming was done in
[CodeSkulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org), an online programming environment
built by one of the instructors. As CodeSkulptor didn't allow for multiple
files, coding a multi-class program got a little cumbersome, but the site
served it's purpose well.

In the end, I can't say I fell in love with Python, but the course did teach me
some new approaches to solving problems (modular arithmetic, for one).
However, I was definitely sold on the value of online education, especially when
it's coming from accomplished instructors at prominent institutions. Speaking
of which, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Shiller is teaching [a course on
Financial Markets](https://www.coursera.org/course/financialmarkets) this
Spring and I've already signed up.
