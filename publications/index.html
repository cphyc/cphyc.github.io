    <h4><b>ACCESS I: An Optical Transmission Spectrum of GJ 1214b Reveals a Heterogeneous Stellar Photosphere</b></h4>
    Rackham, <b>Espinoza</b> et al., 2016, ApJ, in press.<br>
    <font size="2" align="justify"><i>What is the article about?</i> <br> 
       In this work, we used Magellan/IMACS in order to study the atmosphere of the 
       exoplanet GJ1214b, which is the most studied sub-Neptune to date. Past studies have shown that the atmosphere 
       has clouds, which mutes all the spectral signatures of the atmosphere, leaving us with a flat transmission 
       spectrum in many wavelenghts. In the optical, however, the transmission spectrum that we observed not only shows 
       a decreasing slope, but also an overall offset with respect to precise infrarred observations. No exoplanet atmosphere 
       model alone can explain all the data, but adding bright heterogeneities in the stellar photosphere to those atmospheric models 
       beautifully do. This will be very important for future searches of optical atmospheric signatures of planets around M-stars such as 
       GJ1214. We must not forget that we observe planets orbiting <i>stars</i>, which have their own complex photospheres.</font>

    <h4><b>Metal enrichment leads to low atmospheric C/O ratios in transiting giant exoplanets</b></h4>
    <b>Espinoza</b> et al., 2016, Submitted to ApJL.
    <font size="2" align="justify"><i>What is the article about?</i> <br>
    In this letter, we use two ideas in order to predict the C/O ratios in the atmospheres of warm giant planets. The first one, introduced 
    in Oberg et al. (2011) is that, because in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks (outwards of about 2 AU) important molecules such as 
    H2O, CO2 and CO condense out, the solid material will get richer in oxygen than the gas and, thus, the C/O ratio of the solids will be 
    smaller than the C/O ratio of the gas (and of the star). The second one is due to the recent work by Thorngren et al. (2016) in which 
    it is estimated that the envelopes of these warm giant planets are heavily metal enriched, which is a signature of the important ammount 
    of solids these atmospheres accreted during their formation. The consequence of this is that we predict that most of the envelopes of these 
    giant exoplanets should have C/O ratios which are smaller than that of the star, because the ammount of carbon and oxygen accreted from the 
    solid material overwhelms that accreted from the gas. Because most stars have C/O less than 1, this implies these planets should have 
    C/O ratios less than 1 as well. If hot exoplanets form in similar ways as their warm counterparts (which is likely at least for a fraction of 
    them), this implies that water formation should be ubiquitous in them.</font>

    <h4><b>EPIC 220504338b: A dense hot-Jupiter transiting a solar analogue</b></h4>
    <b>Espinoza</b> et al., 2016, Submitted to MNRAS.
    <font size="2" align="justify"><i>What is the article about?</i> <br>
    In this article, we present the discovery of a dense (with a density of about 2 times the density of water) hot-Jupiter orbiting a star which 
    is similar to our own Sun. The planet is among the most dense hot-Jupiters discovered to date, with a likely explaination being the large 
    ammount heavy elements in the planet (which we estimate to be around 110 earth-masses). The planet is about 30 percent more massive than 
    Jupiter, but 10 percent smaller, and the level of irradiation that it receives from its host star is just above the limit in which we 
    believe inflation mechanisms start to be important for these hot, big exoplanets. The planet was discovered using photometry from the K2 
    mission, and radial-velocities from the FEROS spectrograph.</font>

    <h4><b>Discovery and Validation of a High-Density sub-Neptune from the K2 Mission</b></h4>
    <b>Espinoza</b> et al., 2016, ApJ, 830, 43.
    <font size="2" align="justify"><i>What is the article about?</i> <br>
    In this article, we report the discovery of a planet which is only 2 times the size of Earth, but 16 times more massive! Although the 
    error on our mass measurement are large (6 earth-masses), this is a very interesting planet because of many reasons. First, the planet 
    falls just where two-layer models of planetary structure predict planets made of pure rock to fall. Of course, these models are too simple 
    to explain most of planets, and is likely that this planet is not made of pure rock but, instead, has either large fractions of water and/or 
    a thick hydrogen envelope. Second, taking its radius and mass at face value, planets as small and massive as this one are rare. However, 
    further data is needed in order to better constrain the mass of the planet, which is currently very uncertain. The discovery was made using 
    data from the K2 mission, and observations made with the HARPS spectrograph mounted on the ESO La Silla 3.6m telescope.
