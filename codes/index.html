<h2>Scientific codes</h2>

  <h3 itemprop="name">Ramses</h3>
  <p>
    RAMSES is an open source code to model astrophysical systems, featuring self-gravitating, magnetised, compressible, radiative fluid flows. It is based on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique on a fully-threaded graded octree. RAMSES is written in Fortran 90 and is making intensive use of the MPI library.

    I contributed by improving and tidying up the code that supports particles. Overall, I added 13,352 lines and deleted 15,232.
