<h2>Scientific codes</h2>
<section itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/SoftwareSourceCode">
  <h3 itemprop="name">Ramses</h3>
  <p>
    RAMSES is an open source code to model astrophysical systems, featuring self-gravitating, magnetised, compressible, radiative fluid flows. It is based on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique on a fully-threaded graded octree. RAMSES is written in Fortran 90 and is making intensive use of the MPI library.
    <br/>
    I contributed by improving and tidying up the code that supports particles. Overall, I added 20,000 lines and deleted as many (making me the 7th contributor out of ~50 in terms of number of lines contributed!).

    <br/>
    I am responsible for supporting the RAMSES frontend in yt and significantly contributed to the project (47 pull-requests accepted, contributed 300+ commits).
