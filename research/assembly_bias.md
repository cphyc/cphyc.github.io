# Monte Carlo Tracer Particles

The mass function of the dark matter halos in which galaxies are
found can be rather well approximated using the excursion set
theory. Using this theory, we are able to predict the mass
distribution as well as the accretion rates and the formation times
of halos. In this work, we have provided an extension to the
excursion set theory to account for the anisotropy induced by the
cosmic web, and especially the saddle points (center of
filaments).  <br/> We provide two online representation of the
typical density (blue) and the specific accretion rate (red) in
the frame of a saddle point of the
potential <a href="/research/assembly/no_boost.html">before a
Zeldovich boost</a>
and <a href="/research/assembly/with_boost.html">after a Zeldovich boost</a>.
