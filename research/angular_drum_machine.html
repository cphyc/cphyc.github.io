      Using AngularJS, I developed this stand-alone drum machine to be intuitive and fun to use. Both the individual beats and the tempo can be adjusted in real-time while the machine is playing. The source code has been made available on GitHub.

      Planned enhancements include additional instruments, the ability to save/recall a groove, and a feature to create a groove playlist.
