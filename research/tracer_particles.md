Monte Carlo Tracer Particles are particle advected with the gas in the AMR-oct code RAMSES. They are moved in a stochastic fashion folowing the flux computed by the hydro solver. The code can be requested by mailing <a href="corentin dot cadiou at iap dot fr">me</a> and has been merged in the main version of RAMSES

See the paper on the arXiv [Cadiou+19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11401).
