    <h2>Monte Carlo Tracer Particles</h2>

    <p>
      Monte Carlo Tracer Particles are particle advected with the gas in the AMR-oct code RAMSES. They are moved in a stochastic fashion folowing the flux computed by the hydro solver. The code can be requested by mailing <a href="corentin dot cadiou at iap dot fr">me</a>.
