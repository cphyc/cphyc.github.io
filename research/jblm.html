      Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state commissioned a survey to gather data and to to better meet their needs of their community. I built the online survey and went through several rounds of revisions and testing, including a round of live beta testing with soldiers at JBLM.

      The survey included several unique components. One question had respondents pinpoint the approximate location of their residence on an interactive Google Map. The survey also provided an gift card incentive for community members who completed the survey. I wrote the code to randomly choose and assign gift card winners. Winners were notified in real-time upon completion of the survey.
