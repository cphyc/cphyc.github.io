      Designed by <a href="http://www.salituridesign.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Salituri</a>, Infinite Good allows users to post stories about how they've been inspired by others.

    <p>
      I used Ruby on Rails to build the website backend as well as the API to power the iOS app. Facebook integration was used for user authentication and to post stories to a user's timeline. Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Heroku were used for storage and hosting.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the front-end, I used jQuery to get the user interaction just right. I used several JS libraries to help with components like tooltips and infinite scrolling.
