    <h2>Marketek</h2>
    <h4>Web Design, jQuery, WordPress</h4>
    <p>
      Marketek's original website was built with Flash more than 10 years ago. The team brought me in to modernize and redesign the site, making it mobile-friendly and more visually interesting. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Three design mockups were provided, one was chosen, and the site is currently being built in WordPress using the latest HTML5/CSS3 web standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site is currently in beta.
